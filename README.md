Clarify Requirements
"First, I'd clarify the requirements with the interviewer. In this case, we need a backend system for customer accounts, transactions, and e-commerce functionality. I'd ask about expected scale, performance requirements, and any specific features they're looking for."
Identify Key Entities
"Next, I'd identify the key entities in our system:

Customers: The users of our system
Accounts: Financial accounts associated with customers
Transactions: Records of financial activities
Products: Items available for purchase
These form the core of our data model."


Define Relationships
"Then, I'd define the relationships between these entities:

A Customer can have one or more Accounts
An Account belongs to one Customer
An Account can have multiple Transactions
A Transaction belongs to one Account
Products exist independently but are involved in purchase Transactions"


Outline Core Functionalities
"Based on the requirements, I'd outline the core functionalities:

Customer management: registration, verification, authentication
Account management: creation, balance tracking
Transaction handling: recording deposits, withdrawals, purchases
Product management: listing, inventory tracking
Purchase process: buying products, updating balances and inventory"


Design Class Structure
"With these in mind, I'd design the class structure:

Customer class: stores customer information
Account class: manages account details and transactions
Transaction class: represents individual financial transactions
Product class: represents items for sale
AccountSystem class: orchestrates interactions between other classes"


Consider Security Aspects
"Security is crucial, so I'd incorporate:

Password hashing for customer accounts
Email validation for registration
Customer verification process before allowing account creation"


Plan for Scalability
"To ensure the system can handle growth:

Use of efficient data structures (e.g., dictionaries for quick lookups)
Design methods to be independent and modular for easy scaling
Consider future implementation of database integration"


Think About Edge Cases
"I'd consider edge cases and error handling:

What if a customer tries to buy a product with insufficient funds?
How do we handle attempts to create duplicate accounts?
What if a product is out of stock?"


Discuss Potential Enhancements
"Finally, I'd mention potential future enhancements:

Implementing a simple chatbot for customer queries
Adding a recommendation system based on purchase history
Generating detailed account statements
Integrating with external payment systems"


Reflect on Trade-offs
"Throughout the design process, I'd consider trade-offs. For example, storing transactions in memory is simple but not scalable for a real-world application. In a production environment, we'd need to use a database."
